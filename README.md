# The [THING](https://mattnannetti.github.io/restaurant-css-framework/)

#### What -
The THING is a burger restaurant mock-up website. 
This was created as part of my training at BeCode Brussels, specifically aiming to practise Bootstrap.

#### When -
I've been working on this project for a couple of days at the end of June 2020.

#### Who -
This had to be done solo, so I'm the sole contributor.

#### Tools -
- HTML5
- CSS 3
- Bootstrap
- JQuery

#### Some thoughts -

This was a fun project to work on. Pretty much the first website I got to put together all by myself,
and that was quite satisfactory. I'm not mad at the result either :-)
